## Limitations of the Dataset 

1. There is some incomplete data 

2. We donâ€™t have a clue as to how marketing worked. Did the ones that succeed have a certain audience reach? What did audience talk look like?

3. How did the project starters communicate with backers? Were there updates, thank yous, or follow-ups?

4. What website is this? And where is this website most trafficked?
-Supposing this website is only popular in the USA, then we could be led to selection bias. 

5. On some crowdfunding sites, you can add incentives (All access pass, extra behind the scenes, meet-n-greet with the cast). Did the successful projects have incentives?

6. Who backed these projects? (Were most people who pledged: Millenials, Baby Boomers with $36,000 income, GenZers with $100,000 or more income, etc.?)
